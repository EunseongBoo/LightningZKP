# LightningZKP

This project is for low-cost and fast Zero Kwolege Proof on Ethereum chain.
Users can send their ERC-20 tokens to another user anonymously. 
This project is based on ["optimistic-zkdai" project](https://github.com/atvanguard/optimistic-zkdai#optimistic-zkdai).

I ported the ["optimistic-zkdai" project](https://github.com/atvanguard/optimistic-zkdai#optimistic-zkdai). (solditity 0.4.25) to solidity 0.5.2, and some key features have been added for low-cost and fast ZKP.
