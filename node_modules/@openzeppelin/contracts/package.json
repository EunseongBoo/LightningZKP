You can read ṫhe details in our [API Stability](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/api-stability/138) document.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo write your custom contracts, import ours and extend them through inheritance.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Mintable.sol\";\n\ncontract MyNFT is ERC721Full, ERC721Mintable {\n  constructor() ERC721Full(\"MyNFT\", \"MNFT\") public {\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> You need an ethereum development framework for the above import statements to work! Check out these guides for [Truffle], [Embark] or [Buidler].\n\nOn our site you will find a few [guides] to learn about the different parts of OpenZeppelin, as well as [documentation for the API][API docs]. Keep in mind that the API docs are work in progress, and don’t hesitate to ask questions in [our forum][forum].\n\n## Security\n\nOpenZeppelin the project is maintained by [Zeppelin] the company, and developed following our high standards for code quality and security. OpenZeppelin is meant to provide tested and community-audited code, but please use common sense when doing anything that deals with real money! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions and any security problems you might experience.\n\nThe core development principles and strategies that OpenZeppelin is based on include: security in depth, simple and modular code, clarity-driven naming conventions, comprehensive unit testing, pre-and-post-condition sanity checks, code consistency, and regular audits.\n\nThe latest audit was done on October 2018 on version 2.0.0.\n\nPlease report any security issues you find to security@openzeppelin.org.\n\n## Contribute\n\nOpenZeppelin exists thanks to its contributors. There are many ways you can participate and help build high quality software. Check out the [contribution guide]!\n\n## License\n\nOpenZeppelin is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n\n[API docs]: https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/token_ERC721_ERC721BasicToken.html\n[guides]: https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/get-started.html\n[forum]: https://forum.zeppelin.solutions\n[Zeppelin]: https://zeppelin.solutions\n[contribution guide]: CONTRIBUTING.md\n[Truffle]: https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/quickstart\n[Embark]: https://embark.status.im/docs/quick_start.html\n[Buidler]: https://buidler.dev/guides/#getting-started\n",
